### How it works
In order to run this app, you need to 
- grab your own API key from Openweather.com. Please register and you will be given a key.  
- After receiving the key, copy and paste it somewhere temporary (notes) and don't share it. You will need this in a while.  
- You can download the repository or clone it with your IDE by typing this in your terminal:  git clone https://github.com/marcolepdev/weather_app.git  
- Open the app.js file in your Text editor and insert, by leaving the single quotes, your own API key, in the code at the following line:

const apiKey = 'API_KEY';  
- Save the file and close it.  
- Double click on the index.html, type a city and click on the "search button".  
- Enjoy!
